# Vue.js To-Do App

This project stems from the completion of [this Vue.js 2 tutorial from scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2). It's a pretty lazy tutorial ripe with typos, which I was able to work around with my working knowledge of ES6 and React.

Follow the tutorial to get the basic gist of how Vue.js works, then clone my repo to check out my fixes to the issues.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

## Intro to Vue.js
[Here's my cheat sheet to Vue.js](https://gist.github.com/dalazaro/ea61a64ffb94f9ea2cbbc6399cbbbdc2), which I wrote for my lightning talk in WDI 39 at GA SF.
